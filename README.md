# Ruslan Pilikhevych

Software Engineer focused on building scalable, reliable systems and real-world products.

## About Me

I work on systems where correctness matters more than hype.

My focus is on:
- backend-driven architectures
- payment & order lifecycles
- data consistency and synchronization
- long-living projects, not demos

I prefer solving problems that appear *after* MVP:
race conditions, edge cases, broken states, real users.

## Engineering Principles

- State before action: data must exist before payments, not after
- Idempotency over retries
- Explicit states instead of booleans
- Systems must recover from failure, not just avoid it
- Infrastructure should explain itself through code

## Tech Stack

- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL
- Backend: Supabase, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind
- Payments: Authorize.Net
- Integrations: external APIs, marketplace sync
- Tooling: Git, CI/CD, background jobs
